# NSCA — Nodal System Components API

Welcome to my project! I’m Mark4401.

This repository represents a passion project I’ve long **yearned** for — a space where I can tackle the hardest parts of programming, **showcase** my work, guide others, and create a community where new developers can find **guidance and understanding**.

Looking back, most tutorials and videos on YouTube suggest starting with **Python, JavaScript, or TypeScript**. Of these, **Python** is genuinely useful, while I see **JavaScript and TypeScript** mostly as a joke — trying to be anything beyond web development.

The reliance on countless **npm dependencies** just to build a simple webpage can feel overwhelming. But hey, that’s just my view — sometimes **less is more**.

That’s why I love the **beauty of C/C++**: powerful, flexible, but not forgiving — one mistake, and you can really shoot yourself in the foot.

For those who have seen or cloned my repo before, thank you for your **interest** in my work. You can find the previous [README Overview](./Markdown/Application_&_Library_Overview.md) which goes over my DX11 library.

For now, I will focus on **DirectX 11 graphics programming**, but I plan to branch out into other areas of development as the project grows.

This first iteration may be **unorthodox**, but that’s the point — learning and refining your skills comes from experimentation.

Well, that’s it for now. Thank you! \:P
